# What is a Cryptocurrency?

The original definition of cryptocurrency was that of digital or virtual money secured by cryptography. There is no physical version of cryptocurrency (like bills or coins). This definition could easily include cryptocurrency issued by your bank or the government.

Today, cryptocurrency has come to mean digital or virtual money, secured by cryptography AND stored on a blockchain. Cryptocurrency is now understood to be *decentralized* cryptocurrency—cryptocurrency stored on a decentralized ledger.

Decentralized cryptocurrency comes with one really big challenge called the *double spend problem*. Since cryptocurrency is nothing more than a copy of a digital file on a ledger, and everyone with a ledger has a copy of the same file, what keeps multiple people from spending the same tender multiple times? Nothing. This is a problem that comes down to who owns what.

That’s where blockchain comes in because it solves the double spend problem with cryptocurrency. Recall that the blockchain ensures agreement among all parties prior to a transaction and once the transaction is confirmed, it can never be changed. If you send or receive cryptocurrency via a blockchain, everyone in the network will agree to the nature of the transaction before it is inscribed permanently onto the blockchain ledger.

Cryptocurrency is generally created in one of two ways: mined or minted. Mining cryptocurrency involves members of the blockchain network performing some action or activity for which they are rewarded a specific amount of cryptocurrency according to a pre-defined and agreed-upon formula or algorithm.

Minting cryptocurrency also happens according to a pre-defined and agreed-upon formula or algorithm. But in this case, the algorithm is established by the creators of the specific blockchain and the cryptocurrency comes into existence according to the algorithm without any members of the blockchain network doing anything.
