# Why Bosagora?

Few technologies are invented and perfected at the same time. Such was the case for the first blockchain, which is the central technology behind Bitcoinâ€”the first decentralized cryptocurrency. The first blockchain was very good at doing the two things it was asked to do: consensus and immutability. Beyond that, it is pretty limited.

Once people saw the potential of blockchain to enforce consensus and immutability, they wanted to decentralize other things, like business contracts (called *smart contracts*). Unfortunately, the first blockchain had no capability to do anything other than mine and manage Bitcoin. It was clear that for blockchain to gain wider acceptance, it would need increased functionality.

For blockchain to become even more useful going forward, it needs to evolve beyond the limited capability of early blockchains. There is a fundamental challenge to the evolution of blockchain, however. How to add the freedom and flexibility to do more things while still maintaining consensus and immutability in a decentralized network? This is the challenge that Bosagora has undertaken.
