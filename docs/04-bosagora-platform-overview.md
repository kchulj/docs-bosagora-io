# Bosagora Platform Overview

The Bosagora Foundation was founded to make blockchain technology more of a project enabler. To do that, blockchain must be true to its roots of ensuring consensus and immutability in a decentralized network. But to evolve, it must also enable scalability, efficiency and increased functionality, while simultaneously ensuring transparency, legitimacy, and fairness. This is what Bosagora does.

The Bosagora platform includes its own cryptocurrency (called *BOA*), its own blockchain protocol, a smart contract engine, and an easy-to-use programming language with development tools. The platform enables the creation of *Trust Contracts* and includes an embedded decision-making system called *The Congress Network*.

The guiding principle behind Bosagora is free and inclusive decision-making with deliberative, democratic decision-making about changes to the blockchain. All of these combine to create a blockchain ecosystem that ensures transparency of the consensus algorithm and the clarity of contracts.
