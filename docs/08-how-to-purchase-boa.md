# How to Purchase BOA

> **Note**: We are not offering investment advice. Please conduct your own research and due diligence, or consult a financial professional before making any investment decisions.

Like any other cryptocurrency, BOA can be purchased using one of the exchanges. We do not recommend any particular exchange, as there are many great options. You can see the list of available exchanges and the current price of BOA at [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bosagora/markets/).

**Step 1 Download a wallet**

1.	Download and install a cryptocurrency wallet that supports BOA.
2.	Create a new wallet and name it.
3.	Activate your new wallet and be sure to write down your new passwords. Your passwords are the only way you can access your wallet so keep them in a safe place and don’t lose them. You will have two passwords: one for spending (which is the one used for transacting on an exchange) and a 12- or 24-word passphrase (which depends on the wallet you chose).
4.	Recreate your passphrase and accept the terms and conditions. The wallet should now be all set.
5.	Click **Receive** and copy the wallet address or download a PDF file with the QR code. You will need to use this address to receive your cryptocurrency later.

**Step 2 Choose an exchange**

1.	Explore cryptocurrency exchanges and choose one that supports BOA.
2.	Create an account. To create an account, exchanges typically require the following information:

  + Full name
  + Address
  + Email address and phone number
  + Payment method (to fund your account)
  + A document that identifies your personality (passport, driver’s license, ID, etc)

We recommend setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security. It usually takes from several minutes to several days for an account to be activated which depends on the exchange you choose.

**Step 3 Purchase BOA**

1.	Sign in to your exchange account.
2.	Select a Buy/Sell option, which is usually on the top menu.
3.	Click **Buy** and enter BOA (Bosagora) as the cryptocurrency you wish to purchase.
4.	Indicate the amount of BOA you would like to purchase and select a payment method (whether it is a wire transfer, credit, or debit card). Each exchange will offer you available options. Please read them carefully and follow the outlined steps.
5.	Confirm your purchase. You will typically have to confirm it via email and enter the 2FA code (if you set it up). You will then receive your BOA on the exchange account.
6.	Withdraw BOA to your personal wallet. If this is the first time you are making a withdrawal, try a small amount to verify that everything works. It is not recommended to store BOA (or any other cryptocurrency) in your exchange account. To transfer your BOA, choose the **Withdraw** option, paste your wallet address (the one you copied earlier from your wallet) and submit your transfer.
7.	Check to see if you have received your funds by going to your wallet and checking the balance. You can also track recent transactions using different explorer tools.

You can now store BOA in your personal wallet, transact between different addresses and receive more BOA as rewards.
