# DAO

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is, in essence, computer code that is distributed on a blockchain. The computer code is written to automate organizational decisions and rules (including cryptocurrency transactions). The decisions and rules of the DAO are embedded in the code and execute automatically without human intervention. Both the rules and subsequent actions are recorded on the blockchain, which means everything is transparent and cannot be tampered with.

In Bosagora, The Congress Network is a DAO.

## The Congress Network

The Congress Network is the decision-making body for Bosagora comprised of fully synchronized node operators. The Congress Network was created to enable effective and inclusive collaboration among the various project stakeholders to continuously enhance the Bosagora software and ecosystem. For example, decisions on a system upgrade can be made through proposal, review, and voting within the Congress Network.

All node operators of Bosagora can join The Congress Network. The Congress Network adheres to the 1-node-to-1-vote rule. There are two subjects about which The Congress makes decisions: system upgrade proposals and how to spend the Commons Budget.

To ensure The Congress Network is inclusive and efficient, we will implement [Votera](https://www.voteranow.com/), an online decision making tool. Votera has the following characteristics:

+ Anonymity
+ Flexibility
+ Convenience
+ Archiving
+ Reporting

## Rewards

Members of The Congress Network can receive rewards (in BOA) for participating in the Congress. There are two ways for them to receive rewards: *confirmation rewards* and *transaction fees*.

**Confirmation Rewards**: Are given to a node when a block is confirmed. This reward is crucial in providing a financial incentive to operate a node. The quantity issued to a node is proportional to the quantity of frozen BOA held in the node. The rewards are distributed to validators when a new block is created.
