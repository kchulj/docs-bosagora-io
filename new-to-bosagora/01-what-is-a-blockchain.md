Ever since the beginning, people have been trying to figure out how to get rid of the middleman. Every time you login somewhere on the internet, whether it’s Facebook or your bank, that’s a middleman. And the middleman owns and controls the database you log into. On the internet, up until recently, there was nothing but middlemen.

It would be nice if we could get rid of the middleman. Just let everyone have their own copy of the database so they could interact with each other without a middleman. There are two big challenges with this. First, you have to make sure everyone’s copy of the database is the same and second, you have to make sure nobody messes with it. In other words, you have to trust everyone. And in a network where you don’t know everyone, that can be hard to do.

Blockchain is a way to get rid of the middleman. It does that by distributing the database (or ledger) to everyone who wants to participate in the blockchain network. That’s why blockchain is also referred to as a *distributed ledger*. More importantly, the blockchain also makes sure everyone’s copy of the database is the same and that nobody changes anything.

How does the blockchain do that? Two ways. First, periodic entries (called *blocks*) are made in the blockchain ledger that everyone agrees is accurate before they make the entry. The blockchain uses complex mathematics, called a *consensus algorithm*, to ensure agreement.

Once the agreed-upon entry is made, the blockchain then ensures that it is impossible to change the entry. This idea of making something impossible to change once it is written is called *immutability* and it’s the key to the power of blockchain.

The blockchain ensures immutability by linking each of the blocks in the ledger together in chronological order. They are linked in such a way that a change to any one block would change every block from that one forward and that one change would be immediately apparent to everyone in the network who would know something has changed. The participants in the network would get together and reject that change.

What do these blocks contain? They can contain any data, but mostly what they contain are transactions in chronological order. Transactions like deposits and withdrawals into an account or transfer of ownership of some asset. The kinds of transactions you definitely want to be immutable because the details of these transactions are permanently imprinted into the blockchain.
